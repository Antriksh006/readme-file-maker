Response for app_test.txt:
This Python code provides a query assistant that processes user queries related to the Bhagavad Gita and Patanjali Yoga Sutras. The code utilizes various libraries and models, including SentenceTransformer, Pinecone, Groq, QdrantClient, and Llama-3-8b-8192. The primary purpose of this code is to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries by analyzing the context and searching for matching text in large databases.

The code defines several functions, including `chain_of_thought`, `get_bot_response`, `check_valid`, `check_valid_answer`, `check_type`, `rewrite_query`, and `rewrite_yoga_sutras_query`, which are used to process and analyze user queries. The `process_query` function is the core of the query assistant, which takes a user query as input, processes it, and returns a response based on the results of the query.
