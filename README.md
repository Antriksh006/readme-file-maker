## 🌟 Overview
AI README Maker is a Python module designed to automate the generation of comprehensive README files for GitHub repositories. It utilizes the Groq API to generate descriptions for each code file, creating a detailed and informative README.

### 🏆 Key Features
- **Automated README Generation**: Generate README files with ease, saving time and effort.
- **Groq API Integration**: Leverage the power of the Groq API to generate high-quality descriptions for code files.
- **Error Handling**: Smooth execution process with built-in error handling and exception management.

## ✨ Installation
To install AI README Maker, run the following command:
```bash
pip install readmer-maker-py
```
### 🚀 Usage
Use the module by running the following command:
```bash
readme-maker-py -k <groq_key> -r <GithubName>/<GithubRepoName>
```
Replace `<groq_key>` with your actual Groq API key and `<GithubName>/<GithubRepoName>` with the name of your GitHub repository.

## 📚 Code Explanation
The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries, including `argparse`, `github`, `nbformat`, and `groq`. It processes each file in the repository, generating descriptions using the Groq API and combining them to create a comprehensive README file.

### 🗂️ Project Structure
